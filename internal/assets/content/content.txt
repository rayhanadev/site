Hi, I'm Ray! ( •ᴗ•)⸝

Right now I'm an engineer at [Million](https://million.dev) (YC W24), where I work on
infrastructure that lets humans build software at scale with AI
agents. Before that, I was at Replit fighting spam and abuse, at
Deel shipping marketing tools, and a mix of SWE roles in-between.

I'm also President of [Purdue Hackers](https://purduehackers.com), where I get to create spaces
for people to build wacky and ambitious things together.

I write occasionally about cool tech stuff I build on my [Substack](https://rayhanadev.substack.com).

I like hard problems and cool people. If you're working on
something interesting, please [say hi](mailto:me@rayhanadev.com)!
